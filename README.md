# Accordion

Accordion directive for angular

> Very much under construction!
> This is a playfround project for me it is NOT stable and NOT mature.

## How to use it 
If you, despite the above warning, still want to use it:

Add the javascript and styling to your html:

```html
   <head>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="../accordion/css/accordion.css">
   </head>
   
   <body>
     <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular.js/1.3.14/angular.min.js"></script>
     <script type="text/javascript" src="../accordion/js/accordion.js"></script>
  </body>
```
Declare a dependency on the accordion module
```javascript
 var app = angular.module('app',['accordion']);
```
